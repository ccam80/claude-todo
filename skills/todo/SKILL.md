Read ONLY the summary table at the top of `C:\Users\cca79\.claude\todo.md` (everything between `## Summary` and `## Tasks`) and print it verbatim.

Do NOT read or display the full task descriptions below the table. Do NOT ask which task to work on — just print the table and stop. The user will indicate their next move.
